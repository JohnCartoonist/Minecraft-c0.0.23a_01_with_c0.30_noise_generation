# Minecraft-c0.0.23a_01_with_c0.30_noise_generation
This is the source code for a Minecraft Classic 0.0.23a_01 mod I made myself in a couple of minutes. This mod modifies some of the noise generators to resemble the ones from Minecraft Classic 0.30 and nothing else. It is a quick experiment I put together out of curiosity.
